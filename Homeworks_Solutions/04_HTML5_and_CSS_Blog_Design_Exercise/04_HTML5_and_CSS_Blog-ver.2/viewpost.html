                                <h2>Conor Lamb Wins Pennsylvania House Seat, Giving Democrats a Map for Trump Country</h2>
                            </header>

                            <p>
                                Conor Lamb, a Democrat and former Marine, scored a razor-thin but extraordinary upset 
                                in a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania after a few thousand absentee 
                                ballots cemented a Democratic victory in the heart of President Trump's Rust Belt base.

                                The Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, may still contest the outcome. But Mr. Lamb's 
                                627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable, given that the four counties 
                                in Pennsylvania's 18th district have about 500 provisional, military and other absentee 
                                ballots left to count, election officials said.
                                    
                                That slim margin - out of almost 230,000 ballots cast in a district that Mr. Trump carried 
                                by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016 - nonetheless upended the political landscape ahead 
                                of November's midterm elections. It also emboldened Democrats to run maverick campaigns 
                                even in deep-red areas where Republicans remain bedeviled by Mr. Trump's unpopularity.
                                    
                                Republican officials in Washington said they were likely to demand a recount through 
                                litigation, and the National Republican Congressional Committee put out a call for voters 
                                to report any irregularities in the balloting. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the committee, 
                                said the party was "not conceding anything".
                                    
                                The battle for a district in suburban and rural areas around Pittsburgh underscored the 
                                degree to which Mr. Trump's appeal has receded across the country. And it exposed the ways 
                                in which both parties are weighed down by divisive leaders: Democrats by Nancy Pelosi, 
                                the House minority leader; Republicans by Mr. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House.
